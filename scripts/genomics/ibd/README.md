Assign contigs to replicons and perform IBD

- `blash.sh` blasts genomes against the two references
- `clean_blash.R` assigns contigs to replicons
- `make_gpa_by_replicon.R` assigns the gpa file to replicon based on which contig its on
- `compute_sccg_snps.R` computes genomic distance based on SNPs in single-copy core genes
- `compute_gcv_diff.R` computtes genomic distance based on gpa
