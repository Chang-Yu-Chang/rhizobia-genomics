This folder contains scripts for analyzing the genomics data including:

1. `raw_reads`: examine raw reads
2. `genomes`, `contigs`: examine assembled genome size and aggregate contig data
3. `gene_content`: examine gene content on panaroo outputs
4. `taxonomy`: aggregates the blast results
5. `fst`, `gcv_fst`: compute fst for SNPs and GCV (gene content variation)
6. `dxy`, `gcv_dxy`: compute dxy for SNPs and GCV
7. `go`, `gcv_go`: perform GO enrichment analysis for SNPs and GCV
